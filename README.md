🏠 House Price Prediction – ML Project Overview
This Jupyter Notebook builds a machine learning model to predict house prices based on property features.

🔹 Data Preparation
📥 Loads the dataset, fills missing values, and uses Label Encoding for categorical columns like property_type, location, and furnishing.

🔹 Feature Selection
📊 Selects important input features (like bedrooms, location, area) and sets the target variable (price).

🔹 Model Training
🤖 Trains a Random Forest Regressor on the training data and evaluates it using accuracy and R² score.

🔹 Prediction & Visualization
📈 Compares predicted vs. actual prices using plots and shows which features are most important for prediction.
